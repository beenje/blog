While reading more about `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io>`_, I
discovered it was possible to control your accessories from Home Assistant
with Siri and HomeKit. I decided to give that a try.

This requires to install `Homebridge <https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge>`_ and
the `homebridge-homeassitant plugin <https://github.com/home-assistant/homebridge-homeassistant>`_.


Install Homebridge
==================

Homebridge is a lightweight NodeJS server that emulates the iOS HomeKit
API. Let's install it in the same `LXC container as Home Assistant
</posts/home-assistant-on-turris-omnia-via-lxc-container>`_::

    root@turris:~# lxc-attach -n homeassistant

I followed the `Running HomeBridge on a Raspberry Pi page
<https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki/Running-HomeBridge-on-a-Raspberry-Pi>`_.

We need curl and git::

    root@homeassistant:~# apt-get install -y curl git

Install Node::

    root@homeassistant:~# curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | bash -
    ## Installing the NodeSource Node.js v6.x repo...

    ## Populating apt-get cache...

    root@homeassistant:~# apt-get install -y nodejs

Install avahi and other dependencies::

    root@homeassistant:~# apt-get install -y libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev

Install Homebridge and dependencies still following this `page
<https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/wiki/Running-HomeBridge-on-a-Raspberry-Pi#install-homebridge-and-dependencies>`_.
Note that I had a strange problem here. The *npm* command didn't produce
any output. I found the same issue on `stackoverflow
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40755598/containers-lxc-attach-and-npm-no-output>`_
and even an `issue on github <https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/15681>`_.
The workaround is just to open a new terminal...

::

    root@homeassistant:~# npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge hap-nodejs node-gyp
    root@homeassistant:~# cd /usr/lib/node_modules/homebridge/
    root@homeassistant:/usr/lib/node_modules/homebridge# npm install --unsafe-perm bignum
    root@homeassistant:/usr/lib/node_modules/homebridge# cd ../hap-nodejs/node_modules/mdns/
    root@homeassistant:/usr/lib/node_modules/hap-nodejs/node_modules/mdns# node-gyp BUILDTYPE=Release rebuild


Install and configure homebridge-homeassistant plugin
=====================================================

::

   root@homeassistant:/usr/lib/node_modules/hap-nodejs/node_modules/mdns# cd
   root@homeassistant:~# npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge-homeassistant
   
Try to start Homebridge::

   root@homeassistant:~# su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
   homeassistant@homeassistant:~$ homebridge

Homebridge won't do anything until you've created a configuration file.
So press CTRL-C and create the file `~/.homebridge/config.json`::

    homeassistant@homeassistant:~$ cat <<EOF >> ~/.homebridge/config.json
    {
      "bridge": {
    	"name": "Homebridge",
    	"username": "CC:22:3D:E3:CE:30",
    	"port": 51826,
    	"pin": "031-45-154"
      },
    
      "platforms": [
    	{
    	  "platform": "HomeAssistant",
    	  "name": "HomeAssistant",
    	  "host": "http://localhost:8123",
    	  "logging": false
    	}
     ]
    }
    EOF

Note that you can change the username and pin code.
You will need the PIN code to add the Homebridge accessory to HomeKit.

Check the `Home Assistant plugin page
<https://github.com/home-assistant/homebridge-homeassistant#configuration>`_
for more information on how to configure the plugin.

Automatically start Homebridge
==============================

Let's configure systemd.
Create the file `/etc/systemd/system/home-assistant@homebridge.service`::

    root@homeassistant:~# cat <<EOF >> /etc/systemd/system/home-assistant@homebridge.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Node.js HomeKit Server
    After=syslog.target network-online.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=homeassistant
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/homebridge -U /home/homeassistant/.homebridge
    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=10
    KillMode=process
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF

Enable and launch Homebridge::

   root@homeassistant:~# systemctl --system daemon-reload
   root@homeassistant:~# systemctl enable home-assistant@homebridge
   Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/home-assistant@homebridge.service to /etc/systemd/system/home-assistant@homebridge.service.
   root@homeassistant:~# systemctl start home-assistant@homebridge


Adding Homebridge to iOS
========================

Homebridge and the Home Assistant plugin are now running.
Using the Home app on your iOS device, you should be able to add the accessory "Homebridge".
See `Homebridge README
<https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#adding-homebridge-to-ios>`_ for
more information. You will need to enter the *PIN code* defined in your
`config.json` file.

You should then see the Homebridge bridge on your device:

And it will automatically add all the accessories defined in Home Assistant!

You can now even use Siri to control your devices, like turning ON or OFF the TV VPN.

Note that I renamed the original switch to make it easier to pronounce.
As described in the `README
<https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#interacting-with-your-devices>`_,
avoid names usually used by Siri like "Radio" or "Sonos".

That's it! Homebridge is really a nice addition to Home Assistant if you have some iOS devices at home.
