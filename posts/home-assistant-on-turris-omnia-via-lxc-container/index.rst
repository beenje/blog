In a previous post, I described `how to install OpenVPN client on a Turris
Omnia router </posts/openvpn-source-based-routing>`_. To start or stop the
client, I was using the command line and mentioned the LuCi Web User
Interface.

Both ways are not super easy and fast to access.
A while ago, I wrote a small `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_ web
application to change some settings in my router. The application just
allowed to click on a button to run a script via ssh on the router.

So I could write a small webapp to do just that.
But I recently read about `Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io>`_. It's
an open-source home automation platform to track and control your devices
at home. There are many components available, including `Command Line
Switch <https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.command_line/>`_ which
looks exactly like what I need.

The Raspberry Pi is a popular device to install Home Assistant.
But my `Turris Omnia <https://omnia.turris.cz/en/>`_ is quite powerful for a router with
1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of flash. It's time to use some of that power.

From what I `read
<https://forum.turris.cz/t/home-automation-home-assistant-upgrade/1037>`_,
there is an openWrt package of Home Assistant.
I couldn't find it in the Turris Omnia available packages.
Anyway, there is another feature I wanted to try: `LXC Containers
<https://www.turris.cz/doc/en/howto/lxc>`_. Home Assistant is a Python
application, so it's easy to install in a linux container and would allow
to easily keep the version up-to-date.

So let's start!

Create a LXC container
======================

As described `here <https://www.turris.cz/doc/en/howto/lxc>`_, you can
create a LXC container via the LuCI web interface or via the command
line::

    root@turris:~# lxc-create -t download -n homeassistant
    Setting up the GPG keyring
    Downloading the image index
    WARNING: Failed to download the file over HTTPs.
             The file was instead download over HTTP. A server replay attack may be possible!

     Distribution Debian version Jessie was just installed into your
     container.

     Content of the tarballs is provided by third party, thus there is
     no warranty of any kind.

As you can see above, I chose a Debian Jessie distribution.

Let's start and enter the container::

    root@turris:~# lxc-start -n homeassistant
    root@turris:~# lxc-attach -n homeassistant

Now that we are inside the container, we can first set the root password::

    root@LXC_NAME:~# passwd
    Enter new UNIX password:
    Retype new UNIX password:
    passwd: password updated successfully

*LXC_NAME* is not a super nice hostname. Let's update it::

    root@LXC_NAME:~# hostnamectl set-hostname homeassistant
    Failed to create bus connection: No such file or directory

Ok... We have to `install dbus
<http://serverfault.com/questions/685837/how-to-set-the-hostname-for-a-debian-jessie-system>`_.
While we are at it, let's install vim because
we'll need it to edit the homeassistant configuration::

    root@LXC_NAME:~# apt-get update
    root@LXC_NAME:~# apt-get upgrade
    root@LXC_NAME:~# apt-get install -y dbus vim

Setting the hostname now works properly::

    root@LXC_NAME:~# hostnamectl set-hostname homeassistant

We can exit and enter the container again to see the change::

    root@LXC_NAME:~# exit
    root@turris:~# lxc-attach -n homeassistant
    root@homeassistant:~#


Install Home Assistant
======================

Next, we just have to follow the `Home Assistant installation instructions
<https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/installation-virtualenv/>`_.
They are well detailed. I'll just quickly repeat them here to make it
easier to follow but you should refer to the official page for any update::

    root@homeassistant:~# apt-get install python-pip python3-dev
    root@homeassistant:~# pip install --upgrade virtualenv
    root@homeassistant:~# adduser --system homeassistant
    root@homeassistant:~# mkdir /srv/homeassistant
    root@homeassistant:~# chown homeassistant /srv/homeassistant
    root@homeassistant:~# su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
    homeassistant@homeassistant:/root$ virtualenv -p python3 /srv/homeassistant
    homeassistant@homeassistant:/root$ source /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate
    (homeassistant) homeassistant@homeassistant:/root$ pip3 install --upgrade homeassistant

Just run *hass* to start the application and create the default
configuration::

    (homeassistant) homeassistant@homeassistant:/root$ hass

Press CTRL-C to exit.
Check the created configuration file:
`/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant/configuration.yaml`.

You can comment out the `introduction:` line::

Add a switch to Home Assistant
==============================

To start and stop our VPN we define a `Command Line Switch
<https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.command_line/>`_ that
triggers the openvpn script on the router.
Add the following at the end of the file::

	switch:
	  platform: command_line
	  switches:
		atv_vpn:
		  command_on: 'ssh root@<router IP> "/etc/init.d/openvpn start"'
		  command_off: 'ssh root@<router IP> "/etc/init.d/openvpn stop"'
		  friendly_name: ATV4 VPN

The LXC container is just like another computer (a virtual one) on the local network.
To access the router, we have to ssh to it. For this to work without
requesting a password, we have to generate a ssh key and add the public
key to the authorized_keys file on the router::

	homeassistant@homeassistant:~$ ssh-keygen
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/home/homeassistant/.ssh/id_rsa):
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
	Enter same passphrase again:
	Your identification has been saved in /home/homeassistant/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /home/homeassistant/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

Copy the content of `/home/homeassistant/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to
`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` (on the router not inside the container).

With this configuration, the switch will always be off when you restart
Home Assistant. It won't know either if you change the state using the
command line or LuCI web interface.
This can be solved by adding the optional `command_state` line. The
command shall return a result code *0* if the switch is on.
The openvpn init script on the Turris Omnia doesn't take "status" as
argument. An easy way to check if openvpn is running is to use pgrep.
Our new configuration becomes::

	switch:
	  platform: command_line
	  switches:
		atv_vpn:
		  command_on: 'ssh root@<router IP> "/etc/init.d/openvpn start"'
		  command_off: 'ssh root@<router IP> "/etc/init.d/openvpn stop"'
		  command_state: 'ssh root@<router IP> "pgrep /usr/sbin/openvpn"'
		  friendly_name: ATV4 VPN

That's it. The switch state will now properly be updated
even if the VPN is started or stopped without using the application.

If you go to *http://<container IP>:8123*, you should see something like
that:

Automatically start Home Assistant
==================================

Let's configure `systemd
<https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/autostart-systemd/>`_ to automatically
start the application.
Create the file `/etc/systemd/system/home-assistant@homeassistant.service`::

    root@homeassistant:~# cat <<EOF >> /etc/systemd/system/home-assistant@homeassistant.service
    [Unit]
    Description=Home Assistant
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=homeassistant
    ExecStart=/srv/homeassistant/bin/hass -c "/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant"

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF

Enable and launch Home Assistant::

    root@homeassistant:~# systemctl --system daemon-reload
    root@homeassistant:~# systemctl enable home-assistant@homeassistant
    Created symlink from /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/home-assistant@homeassistant.service to /etc/systemd/system/home-assistant@homeassistant.service.
    root@homeassistant:~# systemctl start home-assistant@homeassistant

You can check the logs with::

    root@homeassistant:~# journalctl -f -u home-assistant@homeassistant

We just have to make sure the container starts automatically when we
reboot the router.
Set the following in `/etc/config/lxc-auto`::

	root@turris:~# cat /etc/config/lxc-auto
	config container
	  option name homeassistant
	  option timeout 60


Make it easy to access Home Assistant
=====================================

There is one more thing we want to do: assign a fixed IP to the container.
This can be done like for any machines on the LAN via the *DHCP and DNS* settings in LuCI interface.
In *Static Leases*, assign a fixed IP to the container MAC address.

Now that the container has a fixed IP, go to *http://<container IP>:8123* and
create a bookmark or add an icon to your phone and tablet home screen.
This makes it easy for anyone at home to turn the VPN on and off!
